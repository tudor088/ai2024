\section{Introduction}
This project demonstrates the use of Prover9 to solve the classic \textbf{Knights and Knaves}  puzzle, a logical problem involving truth-tellers and liars. The puzzle serves as an excellent example of how first-order logic and automated reasoning tools like Prover9 can be applied to solve problems that require deductive reasoning.

\subsection{Problem Context}
The problem revolves around three individuals (\texttt{A}, \texttt{B}, and \texttt{C}), each of whom is either a Knight (always tells the truth) or a Knave (always lies). Based on their statements, we aim to deduce:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The roles (Knight or Knave) of \texttt{A}, \texttt{B}, and \texttt{C}.
    \item The location of the treasure (\texttt{l1} or \texttt{l2}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Objectives}
The objectives of this project are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To formulate the problem in first-order logic.
    \item To implement the problem using Prover9.
    \item To prove the goal (\texttt{TreasureAt(l1)}) based on logical assumptions.
    \item To analyze the results and provide insights into the logical deductions.
\end{itemize}

\section{Problem Description}
\subsection{The Puzzle}
Three individuals make the following statements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{A}: "The treasure is at location \texttt{l1}."
    \item \texttt{B}: "A is a knave."
    \item \texttt{C}: "B is a knight."
\end{itemize}
We are tasked with determining:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The roles of \texttt{A}, \texttt{B}, and \texttt{C}.
    \item The location of the treasure.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Logical Constraints}
The puzzle is governed by the following constraints:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Role Constraints}:
    Each individual is either a Knight or a Knave, but not both:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Prover9]
    -(Knight(a) & Knave(a)).
    -(Knight(b) & Knave(b)).
    -(Knight(c) & Knave(c)).
    \end{lstlisting}

    \item \textbf{Treasure Constraints}:
    The treasure is at exactly one of the two locations:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Prover9]
    (TreasureAt(l1) | TreasureAt(l2)).
    -(TreasureAt(l1) & TreasureAt(l2)).
    \end{lstlisting}

    \item \textbf{Truthfulness Constraints}:
    The statements of Knights are always true, while those of Knaves are always false:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Prover9]
    (Knight(a) -> TreasureAt(l1)).
    (Knave(a) -> -TreasureAt(l1)).
    
    (Knight(b) -> Knave(a)).
    (Knave(b) -> -Knave(a)).
    
    (Knight(c) -> Knight(b)).
    (Knave(c) -> -Knight(b)).
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Implementation}
\subsection{Logical Encoding in Prover9}
The puzzle was encoded in Prover9 as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Prover9]
formulas(assumptions).

% Define individuals a, b, c as either knight or knave:
(Knight(a)).
(Knave(b)).
(Knave(c)).

% Ensure mutual exclusivity of Knight and Knave roles
-(Knight(a) & Knave(a)).
-(Knight(b) & Knave(b)).
-(Knight(c) & Knave(c)).

% Exactly one treasure location: l1 or l2
(TreasureAt(l1) | TreasureAt(l2)).
-(TreasureAt(l1) & TreasureAt(l2)).

% A's statements:
% A says: "TreasureAt(l1)"
(Knight(a) -> TreasureAt(l1)).
(Knave(a) -> (-TreasureAt(l1))).

% B's statements:
% B says: "A is a knave."
(Knight(b) -> Knave(a)).
(Knave(b) -> (-Knave(a))).

% C's statements:
% C says: "B is a knight."
(Knight(c) -> Knight(b)).
(Knave(c) -> (-Knight(b))).

end_of_list.

formulas(goals).
TreasureAt(l1).
end_of_list.
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Execution in Prover9}
The above code was executed using Prover9 to prove the goal \texttt{TreasureAt(l1)}. The results were analyzed to derive the roles of the individuals and the location of the treasure.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Prover9 Output}
The following conclusions were derived from the Prover9 output:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{A} is a Knight.
    \item \texttt{B} and \texttt{C} are Knaves.
    \item The treasure is located at \texttt{l1}.
\end{itemize}


The following output was obtained after running the Prover9 code to solve the Knights and Knaves puzzle:

\subsection{Logical Explanation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Since \texttt{A} is a Knight, their statement about the treasure being at \texttt{l1} is true.
    \item \texttt{B} is a Knave, so their claim that \texttt{A} is a Knave is false, confirming \texttt{A} is a Knight.
    \item \texttt{C} is also a Knave, so their claim that \texttt{B} is a Knight is false, confirming \texttt{B} is a Knave.
\end{itemize}
